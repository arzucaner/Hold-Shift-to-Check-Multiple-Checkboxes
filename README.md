# Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes

---

The "Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes" project is part of Wes Bos's "JavaScript30" challenge series. In this particular project, participants learn how to create a checkbox system that allows users to select multiple checkboxes at once by holding down the shift key.

The project consists of a series of coding challenges that gradually introduce concepts related to manipulating checkboxes and detecting keyboard events in JavaScript. Participants will learn how to listen for events on checkboxes, and how to check multiple boxes at once by manipulating the checked property.

Throughout the project, participants will work with various JavaScript events and methods, including click(), forEach(), and Array.prototype.slice(). They will also learn how to detect keyboard events and listen for the shift key using the shiftKey property.

By the end of the "Hold-Shift-to-Check-Multiple-Checkboxes" project, participants will have a solid understanding of how to create a checkbox system that allows users to select multiple checkboxes at once using JavaScript, and will be able to apply this knowledge to their own web projects. They will also have gained experience working with JavaScript events, manipulating DOM elements, and detecting keyboard events. If you'd like to see the code for this project, you can find it on Wes Bos's GitHub repository for the JavaScript30 challenge series.
